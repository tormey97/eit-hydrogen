This also means that high temperature fuel cells can have some very interesting industrial applications and interesting residential applications in places where you have access to cheap hydrogen. Because then, you can use hydrogen as a fuel where you need the energy for stationary purposes \u2013 for instance in a large building, which needs both power and heat. Then you can use hydrogen to provide the total energy with an extremely high utilization efficiency, since you both need the electricity and the heat.

This means that it takes up a lot of volume, and it easily finds its way through cracks and small leakages and so on. If you want to store hydrogen, you need to store it under high pressure as a gas, and that is possible (technologically available now, mature technology) to store hydrogen at 700 bars (or higher, 900). But it costs energy to compress hydrogen to these storage pressures. The hydrogen tanks are also not for free \u2013 these materials that you need to seal off the hydrogen from the environment around at these high pressures. The disadvantages: It is difficult to store it. You can liquify it or have metal hydrites or high pressure. Another disadvantage is that it has a relatively low round trip efficiency if you produce it from electricity, meaning that if you don\u2019t use the excess heat \u2013 you only use the electricity from the fuel cells \u2013 you will have a round trip efficiency of maybe 35%. Or 33%. So, it means that you can easily lose 2/3rd of the amount of energy from electricity through hydrogen back to electricity, if you are not utilizing the excess heat. If you utilize the excess heat you can get a higher total utilization. The last disadvantage , which is maybe my biggest concern, is that the development of hydrogen technology in the last 20 years has been relatively slow compared to other technologies that we can compare it with, such as solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, mobile phones, all types of energy-related technologies. So, it\u2019s still a bit of a \u201cfuel of the future\u201d.

My research has always shown that there is a mix of different sources and energy carriers that can be combined to a more optimal solution. However, we see that electricity has become more important as an energy carrier for renewable energy in the last 5 years than we thought maybe 15 or 20 years ago, where electric vehicles more or less didn\u2019t exist and batteries were at the very premature technology stage compared to now. I would say that hydrogen as an energy carrier for lightweight vehicles has got a very big competitor, in a way. So that is the most important alternative, is electricity. Which has some disadvantages related to long term storage in particular: I would say that batteries, even though they are improving a lot in terms of technology and cost, it is also a resource question about batteries which we have to take into account, because they are not made of \u201crock and soil\u201d \u2013 they are also made of some rare materials. So, to kind of solve every storage problem in the world with lithium iron batteries would not be ideal from a resource point of view. I would just say before we go further from hydrogen as a concept I would say one of the main advantages with hydrogen is its flexibility \u2013 you can produce it from many different sources, you can store it and distribute it in many different ways, and you can utilize it in many different applications. So it\u2019s very attractive as an energy carrier in an energy system which consists of several energy sources on the one side and several end uses on the other side.

I have been working a lot with hydrogen in combination with renewables. You can say \u2013 one great potential could be to utilize electricity sources like solar plants or offshore wind plants far far away from consumption centers, you can produce electricity there, convert it directly where you have the energy source, convert it to hydrogen and then you ship hydrogen long distances to consumers elsewhere, so it\u2019s kind of an export article. I would say this is one great potential, like solar power in Sahara is a classic one that you can then build a lot of solar powers there and sell hydrogen as an environmentally friendly fuel like the oil state now sells fossil fuels. Same can be said for remote wind power. But on the other hand, you can also look at the oil and gas industry and see that hydrogen can be their kind of savior in a climate-constrained world \u2013 how can you make money on fossil fuels in a world that demands climate friendly products"}),Object(n.jsx)(b.a,{children:"If you have natural gas you can convert that to other forms of hydrogen via CCS.

So where would you use it? Well that is also a very good question \u2013 I would say that it is easy I would say to look at the country or areas like continental Europe and large areas in the U.S. where you have a lot of natural gas usage today. And also, for the U.S. where you have very long distances and a lot of trade. This is also the case for Europe. With that combination, it is very difficult to imagine a combination with a pure energy system that replaces all the use of diesel, natural gas and different oils. Then hydrogen can really become an important part, I would say. Also, Japan (Tokyo) has only natural gas driven cars as of today more or less.

If it\u2019s possible to convert this existing system in some way to a hydrogen distribution system without needing to do everything from scratch, we have a very good application there. For vehicles I think it\u2019s simpler because you can imagine that you , it\u2019s like, fueling stations today that are converted to electric vehicle charging places, you have the infrastructure for electricity already so you just make a charger.

Does it require a tradeoff between producing power and hydrogen, or will the surplus energy be sufficient?"}),Object(n.jsx)(b.a,{children:"I think there you can get the answer from Espen on that one. I took a PHD on that topic and then a phd student afterwards took a PhD on the topic and then Espen has completed more or less his PhD on the topic. This is not one easy answer on that, but Espen can train himself to answer that. I can give a short answer first: The question is whether you shall produce hydrogen from surplus energy or not. Most of our analysis shows that if you build a hydrogen plant, this is quite costly. You would then like to produce as much hydrogen as you can when you have the plant. You not only produce hydrogen when you have excess energy. Our research shows that if you need hydrogen, and you want to build a hydrogen infrastructure, then you use that as the primary application of your energy \u2013 and then you use the power grid to sell the excess energy. So that\u2019s the simple answer. You build hydrogen infrastructure and then you utilize it as much as you can, but maybe not 100% - if you overinvest a little bit in hydrogen production capacity then you have some flexibility. Espen\u2019s work has shown that there are economic benefits and environmental benefits of having some flexibility in the hydrogen production so that you can produce a little bit more when the wind is high than when the wind is low. Come back to that with Espen \u2013 he should answer that question in a nice way."}),Object(n.jsx)(b.a,{style:{fontWeight:500},children:"How big of an impact will the use of electrical vehicles have on the power system? Is it possible that hydro vehicles can be a better option to support the rated powers of the components in the power system?"}),Object(n.jsx)(b.a,{children:"Yeah \u2013 that, I would \u2013 say that it would be approximately the same. And I have a very good reason for saying so: because if we imagine that all hydrogen like in Norway comes from natural gas with reforming and CCS, then the answer would be yes: hydrogen vehicles would be a better option looking at the capacity of the grid because all the hydrogen is produced from natural gas \u2013 so you don\u2019t use the electricity system at all. So that is one extreme scenario. The other extreme scenario is where you don\u2019t use the natural gas, but you produce every kilo of hydrogen from renewable energy sources. Then no: this would be worse for the grid, because then you need electricity to produce hydrogen. And you use more electricity to produce hydrogen for vehicles instead of electricity for vehicles because of the efficiency. So in a natural gas hydrogen world you don\u2019t need so much power and power systems. You don\u2019t need so much power in a natural gas world for hydro production, but in the other case you need a lot. I would say, they weight a bit against each other, and you end up with the same as with electric vehicles. Espen has made a great energy system analysis about that recently, should be able to expand a bit on that question."}),Object(n.jsx)(b.a,{style:{fontWeight:500},children:"How can hydrogen provide heat to a building, and how does this work?"}),Object(n.jsx)(b.a,{children:"Yeah \u2013 I don\u2019t know too much about that. I think that the point is that it shouldn\u2019t be very difficult. The point is that if you have a fuel cell system, you have losses. Losses are heat \u2013 so you need to \u2013 first of all, I think that it\u2019s not ideal to burn hydrogen for heating without producing electricity at the same time. I think that it takes \u2013 if you look at the chain from the energy source to hydrogen, and then you finally have hydrogen into your building, you have done a lot of steps to make a fuel that is a bit precious. It\u2019s costly, and very advanced way to get there \u2013 to get this hydrogen. And then you should try to use this for something more than just boiling pasta water. So I would say that when you have first got hydrogen into your building, I believe that the smartest thing to do is to produce electricity and then heat \u2013 heat is produced by excess heat that you use to heat up water in a heat exchanger and so on.

I think that the infrastructure is an important factor an also as I discussed earlier. You can still use hydrogen for other purposes than heating, unless you are in more like remote places where you produce hydrogen from solar panels from windmills near where you need the energy, and then you can use power. You use hydrogen for powering, and then you can use the excess heat as well. Maybe the Utsira case is relevant there \u2013 it was shown how wind power could be used to produce hydrogen which was used in a fuel cell and in a combustion engine, but heat was not used in the demo project.

Then you can have a smaller distribution system for hydrogen locally or regionally And then you produce power in fuel cells \u2013 It could be very attractive in the same way that solar cells are very attractive in residential because if it gets easy to install and not too costly it is a good alternative to large scale power production also. Because if you can just buy fuel cells with integrated heat utilization just as a box, plug and play more or less where you have a hydrogen supply system. Whether it becomes economically viable or not \u2013 it\u2019s not easy to say yet.

Another issue that should not be underestimated is that the public opinion on hydrogen as an energy carrier can be problematic. To have hydrogen gas in your  house, at least in Norway where we are not used to that and think gas systems are very dangerous, which they can potentially be, but in other areas of the world natural gas is very natural to use in residential buildings. And then the step to hydrogen might not be so big. I should consider though, since you are looking at this from a bit broader scale, that you can search a bit about what\u2019s going on on different synthetic hydrogen carriers. There are some systems, concepts regarding ammonia, methanol etc. Hydrogen is the energy carrier, but you can combine it with other chemicals to provide liquid energy carriers that are easy to use.

It\u2019s not only to develop cheap fuel cells \u2013 if you develop cheap fuel cells, you still have to provide an economically viable hydrogen production chain. So, the main difficulty with hydrogen is that you need to solve several things more or less at once when it comes to the techno-economic performance. So, you need to improve hydrogen production, make it easier to distribute hydrogen, and improve the end use technologies. I think that the key here is the fuel cells. And therefore, also the energy research funding in hydrogen technology has focused a lot on fuel cells. Here we have the largest gap between where we are and where we want to be. So, if we solve the fuel cell cost question, that if you get reliable efficient fuel cells at reasonable prices, then the other steps of the chain can be solved more easily.

This can also be like on ships or trucks, because sometimes the weights is limiting on for example trucks  when they driving over bridges and stuff then it can be very limiting if they use batteries and it can limit what kind of payload they can haul.

Probably for different applications based on the location, maybe in aeras were you have a lot of production you can have a lot of hydrogen production as well to complement renewables and  facilitate integrations of renewables, but then in aeras were  you have a lot of energy deficit you can have hydrogen usage for example. Then you can also use it for transports everywhere. I think in the future it would be everywhere. There's a lot of examples. in the Netherlands they are is starting to produce hydrogen in proximity to some of the chemical plants they have because they use hydrogen and, in the production, or in the chemical production process. They have used hydrogen in those processes for a while but now they are also starting to use it from electricity where they previously used natural gas and I also know that they have for example in the port of Amsterdam they are using hydrogen for different applications. In Germany for example they're running trains on hydrogen and there's many places around the world where they're running buses on hydrogen and you can take California as an example there they have a decent amount of hydrogen fueled cars as well and in Japan they also have some had some hydrogen cars and they're very interested in hydrogen as an energy carrier. There\u2019re many more examples of hydrogen usage. So, first of all hydrogen is an energy carrier not an energy source so you should compare it to electricity instead of. You shouldn't say energy source. So, we're it has the greatest potential (relatert til siste halvdel av sp\xf8rsm\xe5let over) I think this goes into what I said before it has potential everywhere so I think it's very dependent on the CO2 price and this CO2 prices reflects how intensely do you want to get rid of CO2 and I think it's going to be very important when you get a little bit further decarbonization so when you get a higher shares of renewables and you start to handle the emitting sources that are hard to decarbonize then hydrogen can be very important."}),Object(n.jsx)(b.a,{style:{fontWeight:500},children:"In the future, how do you think hydrogen will be used in smaller scale application, such as in private residences, vehicle\u2019s etc.?

The best case is if you can have some kind of flexible demand that's only withdrawing energy from the electricity system and then you use it for the end users to decarbonize the things that you can only do with hydrogen If you think about solar energy, then batteries are probably very well suited but for example for wind energy or seasonal variations then you need something like hydrogen because batteries are way too expensive for storing energy over such a long time.

I don't know if it was Telenor or Telia or something, but they have some mobile base station that they need to power somewhere in the mountains in western Norway I think, and then they're actually using hydrogen fuel cells to power those mobile base stations. Because batteries are not sufficient because you can have long periods where you have too little sunshine, so they also had the solar panels on these base stations so it's cheaper than connecting them to the electrical grid Yeah so it's very dependent on the situation but especially for like remote areas or areas that are weakly connected to the electricity grid it can be cheaper, it depends on the alternative so it can be cheaper than building transmission lines maybe in some cases and dependent on the energy source can in some cases be cheaper than batteries. So, it's dependent on both location and energy source. It might not always be the most energy efficient alternative, because you have quite some losses but in some cases, it might be the only alternative because of the costs.

So, now it's still quite early in the deployment of electric hydrogen equipment so it's kind of expensive. It's much cheaper than it used to be, but it has potential to be much cheaper. I can take one example is that until now the electrolyzers, so the equipment used to produce hydrogen from electricity. it's been made by hand in Norway. We have very high labor costs so it's going to be very expensive equipment but now they are actually automating this process of producing the electrolyzers. Its driving down the costs a lot but then again, they are really dependent on some people that want their electrolyzers to have to supply at some volume in order to make the automation profitable. The level of consumption it's key to driving down the investment costs and then also the cost of hydrogen. That's one part of the equation. Then you also have the renewable energy part and that's not very independent from the use of hydrogen you can have a lot of renewable energy without having any hydrogen but still when you have more and more renewable energy hydrogen is going to be cheaper anyway. So, you have some parts that's dependent on the hydrogen consumption and you have some parts that are independent."})]})}],ze=o(153),Re=o.n(ze),Ze=o(154),Me=o.n(Ze),Ke=o(155),Le=o.n(Ke),Ve=N()((function(e){return{container:{display:"flex",flex:"0.15 1 0",backgroundColor:"#EEE",height:"100%"},contents:{flex:1,overflowY:"auto",height:"100%"},page:{display:"flex",flex:"1 1 0",height:"0"}}}));var $e=Object(c.b)()((function(){var e=Ve(),t=i.a.useState(0),o=Object(z.a)(t,2),a=o[0],r=o[1];return Object(n.jsxs)("div",{className:e.page,children:[Object(n.jsx)(X.a,{}),Object(n.jsxs)("div",{className:e.container,children:[Object(n.jsx)(Re.a,{children:Xe.map((function(e,t){return Object(n.jsx)(Me.a,{button:!0,onClick:function(){r(t)},children:Object(n.jsx)(Le.a,{primary:e.title})},t)}))}),Object(n.jsx)(X.a,{})]}),Object(n.jsxs)("div",{className:e.contents,children:[Object(n.jsx)(b.a,{variant:"h6",children:Xe[a].title}),Object(n.jsx)(X.a,{}),Object(n.jsx)(b.a,{children:Xe[a].contents})]})]})})),_e=(l()({palette:{primary:g.a,secondary:u.a}}),N()((function(e){return{mapContainer:{flex:"10 0 0",height:"100%",backgroundColor:"#000"},app:{display:"flex",flexDirection:"column",height:"100%"}}})));var et=Object(c.b)()((function(e){e.t;var t=_e();return Object(n.jsx)("div",{className:t.app,children:Object(n.jsxs)(p.a,{children:[Object(n.jsx)(He,{}),Object(n.jsxs)(f.c,{children:[Object(n.jsx)(f.a,{path:"/eit-hydrogen/map",children:Object(n.jsx)("div",{className:t.mapContainer,children:Object(n.jsx)(Fe,{})})}),Object(n.jsx)(f.a,{path:"/eit-hydrogen/house",children:Object(n.jsx)(Je,{})}),Object(n.jsx)(f.a,{path:"/eit-hydrogen/interviews",children:Object(n.jsx)($e,{})}),Object(n.jsx)(f.a,{path:"/eit-hydrogen/",children:Object(n.jsx)(ne,{})})]})]})})})),tt=function(e){e&&e instanceof Function&&o.e(3).then(o.bind(null,267)).then((function(t){var o=t.getCLS,n=t.getFID,a=t.getFCP,i=t.getLCP,r=t.getTTFB;o(e),n(e),a(e),i(e),r(e)}))},ot=o(118),nt={en:{translation:o(158)},no:{translation:o(159)}};ot.a.use(c.a).init({resources:nt,lng:"en",interpolation:{escapeValue:!1}});ot.a;s.a.render(Object(n.jsx)(i.a.StrictMode,{children:Object(n.jsx)(et,{})}),document.getElementById("root")),tt()}},[[219,1,2]]]);

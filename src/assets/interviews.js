            In which application could hydrogen as an energy source be most beneficial?
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
            I think that hydrogen has most vantage usage in long distance transport due to lack of good alternatives
            with sufficient energy storage capacity like batteries has some range limitations and also limitations
            regarding to size for instance cargo shipping and long-distance road transport, large volumes and also for
            different construction machines and so on. Everywhere where we need a lot of power over a long period of
            time where you need to replace fuels with emission. So that’s the first thing that comes to my mind.
            Then hydrogen as a fuel, I would not call it an energy source, its an energy carrier
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
            Hydrogen is not an energy source – it is an energy carrier. The source can be geothermal,
            solar etc. It carries energy – you can burn it in a fuel cell to produce power and it will also release heat,
            which can both be used together. This also means that high temperature fuel cells can have some very
            interesting industrial applications and interesting residential applications in places where you have
            access to cheap hydrogen. Because then, you can use hydrogen as a fuel where you need the energy for
            stationary purposes – for instance in a large building, which needs both power and heat. Then you can
            use hydrogen to provide the total energy with an extremely high utilization efficiency, since you both
            need the electricity and the heat. This is not uncommon today; we have combined heat and power plants,
            this is also possible for hydrogen, either in fuel cells or in different types of combustion processes.
            There are some other applications as well, but these two came to my mind.
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
            What are some of the greatest disadvantages with the use of hydrogen?
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
            Hydrogen is a very volatile gas – it is the lightest gas that exists.
            This means that it takes up a lot of volume, and it easily finds its way through
            cracks and small leakages and so on. If you want to store hydrogen, you need to store it under high pressure
            as a gas, and that is possible (technologically available now, mature technology) to store hydrogen at
            700 bars (or higher, 900). But it costs energy to compress hydrogen to these storage pressures. The
            hydrogen tanks are also not for free – these materials that you need to seal off the hydrogen from the
            environment around at these high pressures. The disadvantages: It is difficult to store it. You can
            liquify it or have metal hydrites or high pressure. Another disadvantage is that it has a relatively
            low round trip efficiency if you produce it from electricity, meaning that if you don’t use the excess
            heat – you only use the electricity from the fuel cells – you will have a round trip efficiency of maybe 35%.
            Or 33%. So, it means that you can easily lose 2/3rd of the amount of energy from electricity through hydrogen
            back to electricity, if you are not utilizing the excess heat. If you utilize the excess heat you can get
            a higher total utilization. The last disadvantage , which is maybe my biggest concern, is that the development
            of hydrogen technology in the last 20 years has been relatively slow compared to other technologies that
            we can compare it with, such as solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, mobile phones, all types of
            energy-related technologies. So, it’s still a bit of a “fuel of the future”. These are the main disadvantages.
            </Typography>
            What other alternatives are better suited as a sustainable energy source, and why?
            <Typography>
            I would not say that there are any energy sources or energy carriers that are better as a
            “one solution fits all” than others. My research has always shown that there is a mix of different sources
            and energy carriers that can be combined to a more optimal solution. However, we see that electricity has
            become more important as an energy carrier for renewable energy in the last 5 years than we thought maybe
            15 or 20 years ago, where electric vehicles more or less didn’t exist and batteries were at the very premature
            technology stage compared to now. I would say that hydrogen as an energy carrier for lightweight vehicles
            has got a very big competitor, in a way. So that is the most important alternative, is electricity. Which
            has some disadvantages related to long term storage in particular: I would say that batteries, even though
            they are improving a lot in terms of technology and cost, it is also a resource question about batteries
            which we have to take into account, because they are not made of “rock and soil” – they are also made of
            some rare materials. So, to kind of solve every storage problem in the world with lithium iron batteries
            would not be ideal from a resource point of view. I would just say before we go further from hydrogen as
            a concept I would say one of the main advantages with hydrogen is its flexibility – you can produce it from
            many different sources, you can store it and distribute it in many different ways, and you can utilize it
            in many different applications. So it’s very attractive as an energy carrier in an energy system which
            consists of several energy sources on the one side and several end uses on the other side. So, hydrogen
            as a concept is very attractive due to its flexibility.
            </Typography>
            In which parts of the world does hydrogen have the greatest potential for usage as an energy source?
            <Typography>
            Great question – we cannot conclude on that at the moment. I have been working a lot with hydrogen in
            combination with renewables. You can say – one great potential could be to utilize electricity sources
            like solar plants or offshore wind plants far far away from consumption centers, you can produce electricity
            there, convert it directly where you have the energy source, convert it to hydrogen and then you ship
            hydrogen long distances to consumers elsewhere, so it’s kind of an export article. I would say this is
            one great potential, like solar power in Sahara is a classic one that you can then build a lot of solar
            powers there and sell hydrogen as an environmentally friendly fuel like the oil state now sells fossil
            fuels. Same can be said for remote wind power. But on the other hand, you can also look at the oil and gas
            industry and see that hydrogen can be their kind of savior in a climate-constrained world – how can you
            make money on fossil fuels in a world that demands climate friendly products
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
            If you have natural gas you can convert that to other forms of hydrogen via CCS. And sell hydrogen to other
            countries like they now sell fossil fuels. So that is for like the large-scale production. Then we have
            where you would use it – that is where you produce it. So where would you use it? Well that is also a
            very good question – I would say that it is easy I would say to look at the country or areas like
            continental Europe and large areas in the U.S. where you have a lot of natural gas usage today.
            And also, for the U.S. where you have very long distances and a lot of trade. This is also the case for Europe.
            With that combination, it is very difficult to imagine a combination with a pure energy system that replaces
            all the use of diesel, natural gas and different oils. Then hydrogen can really become an important part,
            I would say. Also, Japan (Tokyo) has only natural gas driven cars as of today more or less. And electric,
            but it’s not permitted to have gasoline engines in Tokyo, so they already have a big natural gas supply system.
            So, Japan also should be a very interesting market for hydrogen end use.
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
            In the future, how do you think hydrogen will be used in smaller scale applications such as residences
            vehicles etc.?
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
            Yeah, so, it’s, I think that it depends on the availability of the hydrogen. So, if you have like in private
            residences you must then have easy or relatively easy access to hydrogen. And then the natural gas networks
            as of today can be a key to answering that. If it’s possible to convert this existing system in some way to
            a hydrogen distribution system without needing to do everything from scratch, we have a very good application
            there. For vehicles I think it’s simpler because you can imagine that you , it’s like, fueling stations today
            that are converted to electric vehicle charging places, you have the infrastructure for electricity already
            so you just make a charger. The same goes for hydrogen from electrolysis – you can build an electrolysis
            station at the gas station and then you have hydrogen for the cars. So, I think that is not that difficult.
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
            What about in larger-scale environments such as big cities, large transport networks air travel shipping etc.
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
            I also think that large – scale – so this is another benefit of hydrogen, like electricity it’s very scalable
            I would say. So you can also scale up hydrogen production and transport – maybe that is also beneficial
            from an economic point of view due to the economics of scale – of these technologies, like storages and so
            on, it costs less to build a storage for a kilo stored if it’s large than if it’s small. The same goes for
            production facilities like electrolysis. When it comes to air travel, I don’t… I can’t say anything about
            that, because this is one of the things about hydrogen that I don’t know anything about the feasibility of.
            That would just be pure speculation.
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
            How large will the potential in extracting hydrogen from surplus energy in solar panels and wind turbines
            be? Does it require a tradeoff between producing power and hydrogen, or will the surplus energy be sufficient?
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
            I think there you can get the answer from Espen on that one. I took a PHD on that topic and then a phd
            student afterwards took a PhD on the topic and then Espen has completed more or less his PhD on the topic.
            This is not one easy answer on that, but Espen can train himself to answer that. I can give a short answer
            first: The question is whether you shall produce hydrogen from surplus energy or not. Most of our analysis
            shows that if you build a hydrogen plant, this is quite costly. You would then like to produce as much
            hydrogen as you can when you have the plant. You not only produce hydrogen when you have excess energy.
            Our research shows that if you need hydrogen, and you want to build a hydrogen infrastructure, then you use
            that as the primary application of your energy – and then you use the power grid to sell the excess energy.
            So that’s the simple answer. You build hydrogen infrastructure and then you utilize it as much as you can,
            but maybe not 100% - if you overinvest a little bit in hydrogen production capacity then you have some
            flexibility. Espen’s work has shown that there are economic benefits and environmental benefits of having
            some flexibility in the hydrogen production so that you can produce a little bit more when the wind is high
            than when the wind is low. Come back to that with Espen – he should answer that question in a nice way.
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
            How big of an impact will the use of electrical vehicles have on the power system? Is it possible that hydro
            vehicles can be a better option to support the rated powers of the components in the power system?
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
            Yeah – that, I would – say that it would be approximately the same. And I have a very good reason for
            saying so: because if we imagine that all hydrogen like in Norway comes from natural gas with reforming and
            CCS, then the answer would be yes: hydrogen vehicles would be a better option looking at the capacity of
            the grid because all the hydrogen is produced from natural gas – so you don’t use the electricity system
            at all. So that is one extreme scenario. The other extreme scenario is where you don’t use the natural gas,
            but you produce every kilo of hydrogen from renewable energy sources. Then no: this would be worse for the
            grid, because then you need electricity to produce hydrogen. And you use more electricity to produce hydrogen
            for vehicles instead of electricity for vehicles because of the efficiency. So in a natural gas hydrogen
            world you don’t need so much power and power systems. You don’t need so much power in a natural gas world
            for hydro production, but in the other case you need a lot. I would say, they weight a bit against each
            other, and you end up with the same as with electric vehicles. Espen has made a great energy system analysis
            about that recently, should be able to expand a bit on that question.
            </Typography>

            <Typography>
            How can hydrogen provide heat to a building, and how does this work?
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
            Yeah – I don’t know too much about that. I think that the point is that it shouldn’t be very difficult.
            The point is that if you have a fuel cell system, you have losses. Losses are heat –
            so you need to – first of all, I think that it’s not ideal to burn hydrogen for heating without producing
            electricity at the same time. I think that it takes – if you look at the chain from the energy source to
            hydrogen, and then you finally have hydrogen into your building, you have done a lot of steps to make a fuel
            that is a bit precious. It’s costly, and very advanced way to get there – to get this hydrogen. And then
            you should try to use this for something more than just boiling pasta water. So I would say that when you
            have first got hydrogen into your building, I believe that the smartest thing to do is to produce electricity
            and then heat – heat is produced by excess heat that you use to heat up water in a heat exchanger and so on.
            Combined with hidden power elsewhere. This is not my expert field – some think that using hydrogen only as
            heat, but I think as a combination with power.
            </Typography>

<Typography>
            Sources suggest that the use of hydrogen as a heat-provider for buildings has a larger potential in countries
            where there is the possibility of using existing LNG infrastructure. In other countries where there is a
            high level of established infrastructure for electrical heating, using hydrogen for heating purposes will
            require a higher initial investment. Therefor the integration of hydrogen energy might not be as relevant
            in these countries. What is your opinion on this?

</Typography>
<Typography>
            I agree on that. I think that the infrastructure is an important factor an also as I discussed earlier.
            You can still use hydrogen for other purposes than heating, unless you are in more like remote places
            where you produce hydrogen from solar panels from windmills near where you need the energy, and then you can
            use power. You use hydrogen for powering, and then you can use the excess heat as well. Maybe the Utsira
            case is relevant there – it was shown how wind power could be used to produce hydrogen which was used in a
            fuel cell and in a combustion engine, but heat was not used in the demo project. And that would be
            beneficial from a total energy efficiency and probably economic point of view.
</Typography>
            <Typography>

            Will the use of hydrogen as a heating source mainly be relevant in large scale projects like office and
            public buildings, or can it have a sufficient potential in a private context, for example in a residential unit?
            </Typography>
            I think it’s more ready – easier to integrate in larger buildings. I also think it’s easier to get
            agreements to test out there. So, it’s not either or – it’s like office and public buildings first, and then
            if it works there, the step to residential buildings is – there is a shorter step to there. You don’t
            jump over the office to get to the residential unit – I think that if we succeed with the larger buildings
            then it’s easier to take the technology in use in residential units. And maybe there are some good demo
            examples maybe in office and public buildings from what I know.


            <Typography>

            Does hydrogen as an energy source have other usage areas within a building other than heating?
            </Typography>
            <Typography>

            Yes – micropower plant, if you have hydrogen you can fuel your car as well. If hydrogen cars get cheaper in
            due time, it might be a good alternative to electric vehicles in some areas of the world, e.g. in the U.S.
            for long distance driving etc. and if you have hydrogen available in your residence you can use it for 3
            purposes right?

            </Typography>
            <Typography>


            Could hydrogen fuel cells be used in an environment independent of large networks, such as in a private
            resident, to supply electricity? Would it be economically viable? Would it be energy efficient compared to
            other available alternatives?
            </Typography>
            <Typography>

            So I said a bit about that before, but I think that – well the more expensive the external energy supply is,
            for instance on a remote island and you have costly power or costly diesel oil as an energy source, then
            locally produced hydrogen can be very attractive. Then you can have a smaller distribution system for hydrogen
            locally or regionally And then you produce power in fuel cells – It could be very attractive in the same
            way that solar cells are very attractive in residential because if it gets easy to install and not too
            costly it is a good alternative to large scale power production also. Because if you can just buy fuel
            cells with integrated heat utilization just as a box, plug and play more or less where you have a hydrogen
            supply system. Whether it becomes economically viable or not – it’s not easy to say yet. I’m a bit realistic
            on that – it takes some time, it seems, to get fuel cells to that stage of development. But it’s energy
            efficient if you utilize the heat in addition.
            </Typography>

            <Typography>

            What are some of the disadvantages of the use of hydrogen as a power and heat provider in buildings?
            </Typography>

            <Typography>

            It is the availability and cost of hydrogen into buildings that is the biggest disadvantage. Another issue
            that should not be underestimated is that the public opinion on hydrogen as an energy carrier can be problematic.
            To have hydrogen gas in your  house, at least in Norway where we are not used to that and think gas systems
            are very dangerous, which they can potentially be, but in other areas of the world natural gas is very
            natural to use in residential buildings. And then the step to hydrogen might not be so big. I should
            consider though, since you are looking at this from a bit broader scale, that you can search a bit about
            what’s going on on different synthetic hydrogen carriers. There are some systems, concepts regarding ammonia,
            methanol etc. Hydrogen is the energy carrier, but you can combine it with other chemicals to provide
            liquid energy carriers that are easy to use. Ammonia might be challenging. But that’s also a challenge – to
            get acceptance.

            </Typography>
            <Typography>
            Despite all the research and media coverage of hydrogen as an energy source, it is still not that commonly
            used. Why is hydrogen energy not more prevalent today? What is required for this to happen?
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
            The question, I think, is hard to answer; it seems that hydrogen has some challenges with respect to – you
            need a combination of success storage to make it happen in total. It’s not only to develop cheap fuel cells
            – if you develop cheap fuel cells, you still have to provide an economically viable hydrogen production chain.
            So, the main difficulty with hydrogen is that you need to solve several things more or less at once when it
            comes to the techno-economic performance. So, you need to improve hydrogen production, make it easier to
            distribute hydrogen, and improve the end use technologies. I think that the key here is the fuel cells. And
            therefore, also the energy research funding in hydrogen technology has focused a lot on fuel cells. Here we
            have the largest gap between where we are and where we want to be. So, if we solve the fuel cell cost question,
            that if you get reliable efficient fuel cells at reasonable prices, then the other steps of the chain can be
            solved more easily. Because then you have proved ok, we have an end use application and those applications
            are there, and the rest of the chain can come after. I think fuel cells are the key.
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
            What is the possible cost-advantages or disadvantages of using hydrogen compared to fossil fuel and other
            renewable energy sources? If hydrogen is the most expensive, what action will be required to reduce costs
            so that hydrogen can become competitive?
            </Typography>
            Yeah – so here again it is the fuel cell technology. If we get a breakthrough in fuel cell technology
            like we did lithium-iron batteries and solar cells, then hydrogen can be affordable as an alternative.
            Again, Espen’s research has shown that it is possible to produce hydrogen and deliver it at competitive
            prices in an energy system. But you need to have the end use in place. So, it’s possible to produce at a
            reasonable cost and deliver, so we need the fuel cells to work properly.
            <Typography>
            Will use of hydrogen at the consumer level (i.e. Private transportations and heating) reduce the expenses
            at any level for the consumer?
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
            If carbon emissions are priced correctly, it can potentially be economically beneficial yes. Because then the
            fossil fuel alternative would be so expensive that it’s ruled out. Still, it has to compete with just
            electrifying everything and it’s not really easy to say whether it’s better than direct electricity for
            private transport and heating.

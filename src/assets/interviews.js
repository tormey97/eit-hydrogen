            In which application could hydrogen as an energy source be most beneficial?
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
            I think that hydrogen has most vantage usage in long distance transport due to lack of good alternatives
            with sufficient energy storage capacity like batteries has some range limitations and also limitations
            regarding to size for instance cargo shipping and long-distance road transport, large volumes and also for
            different construction machines and so on. Everywhere where we need a lot of power over a long period of
            time where you need to replace fuels with emission. So that’s the first thing that comes to my mind.
            Then hydrogen as a fuel, I would not call it an energy source, its an energy carrier
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
            Hydrogen is not an energy source – it is an energy carrier. The source can be geothermal,
            solar etc. It carries energy – you can burn it in a fuel cell to produce power and it will also release heat,
            which can both be used together. This also means that high temperature fuel cells can have some very
            interesting industrial applications and interesting residential applications in places where you have
            access to cheap hydrogen. Because then, you can use hydrogen as a fuel where you need the energy for
            stationary purposes – for instance in a large building, which needs both power and heat. Then you can
            use hydrogen to provide the total energy with an extremely high utilization efficiency, since you both
            need the electricity and the heat. This is not uncommon today; we have combined heat and power plants,
            this is also possible for hydrogen, either in fuel cells or in different types of combustion processes.
            There are some other applications as well, but these two came to my mind.

            What are some of the greatest disadvantages with the use of hydrogen?
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
            Hydrogen is a very volatile gas – it is the lightest gas that exists.
            This means that it takes up a lot of volume, and it easily finds its way through
            cracks and small leakages and so on. If you want to store hydrogen, you need to store it under high pressure
            as a gas, and that is possible (technologically available now, mature technology) to store hydrogen at
            700 bars (or higher, 900). But it costs energy to compress hydrogen to these storage pressures. The
            hydrogen tanks are also not for free – these materials that you need to seal off the hydrogen from the
            environment around at these high pressures. The disadvantages: It is difficult to store it. You can
            liquify it or have metal hydrites or high pressure. Another disadvantage is that it has a relatively
            low round trip efficiency if you produce it from electricity, meaning that if you don’t use the excess
            heat – you only use the electricity from the fuel cells – you will have a round trip efficiency of maybe 35%.
            Or 33%. So, it means that you can easily lose 2/3rd of the amount of energy from electricity through hydrogen
            back to electricity, if you are not utilizing the excess heat. If you utilize the excess heat you can get
            a higher total utilization. The last disadvantage , which is maybe my biggest concern, is that the development
            of hydrogen technology in the last 20 years has been relatively slow compared to other technologies that
            we can compare it with, such as solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, mobile phones, all types of
            energy-related technologies. So, it’s still a bit of a “fuel of the future”. These are the main disadvantages.

            <Typography style={{fontWeight: 500}}>
            What other alternatives are better suited as a sustainable energy source, and why?
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
            I would not say that there are any energy sources or energy carriers that are better as a
            “one solution fits all” than others. My research has always shown that there is a mix of different sources
            and energy carriers that can be combined to a more optimal solution. However, we see that electricity has
            become more important as an energy carrier for renewable energy in the last 5 years than we thought maybe
            15 or 20 years ago, where electric vehicles more or less didn’t exist and batteries were at the very premature
            technology stage compared to now. I would say that hydrogen as an energy carrier for lightweight vehicles
            has got a very big competitor, in a way. So that is the most important alternative, is electricity. Which
            has some disadvantages related to long term storage in particular: I would say that batteries, even though
            they are improving a lot in terms of technology and cost, it is also a resource question about batteries
            which we have to take into account, because they are not made of “rock and soil” – they are also made of
            some rare materials. So, to kind of solve every storage problem in the world with lithium iron batteries
            would not be ideal from a resource point of view. I would just say before we go further from hydrogen as
            a concept I would say one of the main advantages with hydrogen is its flexibility – you can produce it from
            many different sources, you can store it and distribute it in many different ways, and you can utilize it
            in many different applications. So it’s very attractive as an energy carrier in an energy system which
            consists of several energy sources on the one side and several end uses on the other side. So, hydrogen
            as a concept is very attractive due to its flexibility.

            <Typography style={{fontWeight: 500}}>
            In which parts of the world does hydrogen have the greatest potential for usage as an energy source?
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
            Great question – we cannot conclude on that at the moment. I have been working a lot with hydrogen in
            combination with renewables. You can say – one great potential could be to utilize electricity sources
            like solar plants or offshore wind plants far far away from consumption centers, you can produce electricity
            there, convert it directly where you have the energy source, convert it to hydrogen and then you ship
            hydrogen long distances to consumers elsewhere, so it’s kind of an export article. I would say this is
            one great potential, like solar power in Sahara is a classic one that you can then build a lot of solar
            powers there and sell hydrogen as an environmentally friendly fuel like the oil state now sells fossil
            fuels. Same can be said for remote wind power. But on the other hand, you can also look at the oil and gas
            industry and see that hydrogen can be their kind of savior in a climate-constrained world – how can you
            make money on fossil fuels in a world that demands climate friendly products
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
            If you have natural gas you can convert that to other forms of hydrogen via CCS. And sell hydrogen to other
            countries like they now sell fossil fuels. So that is for like the large-scale production. Then we have
            where you would use it – that is where you produce it. So where would you use it? Well that is also a
            very good question – I would say that it is easy I would say to look at the country or areas like
            continental Europe and large areas in the U.S. where you have a lot of natural gas usage today.
            And also, for the U.S. where you have very long distances and a lot of trade. This is also the case for Europe.
            With that combination, it is very difficult to imagine a combination with a pure energy system that replaces
            all the use of diesel, natural gas and different oils. Then hydrogen can really become an important part,
            I would say. Also, Japan (Tokyo) has only natural gas driven cars as of today more or less. And electric,
            but it’s not permitted to have gasoline engines in Tokyo, so they already have a big natural gas supply system.
            So, Japan also should be a very interesting market for hydrogen end use.
            </Typography>
            <Typography style={{fontWeight: 500}}>
            In the future, how do you think hydrogen will be used in smaller scale applications such as residences
            vehicles etc.?
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
            Yeah, so, it’s, I think that it depends on the availability of the hydrogen. So, if you have like in private
            residences you must then have easy or relatively easy access to hydrogen. And then the natural gas networks
            as of today can be a key to answering that. If it’s possible to convert this existing system in some way to
            a hydrogen distribution system without needing to do everything from scratch, we have a very good application
            there. For vehicles I think it’s simpler because you can imagine that you , it’s like, fueling stations today
            that are converted to electric vehicle charging places, you have the infrastructure for electricity already
            so you just make a charger. The same goes for hydrogen from electrolysis – you can build an electrolysis
            station at the gas station and then you have hydrogen for the cars. So, I think that is not that difficult.
            </Typography>
            <Typography style={{fontWeight: 500}}>
            What about in larger-scale environments such as big cities, large transport networks air travel shipping etc.
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
            I also think that large – scale – so this is another benefit of hydrogen, like electricity it’s very scalable
            I would say. So you can also scale up hydrogen production and transport – maybe that is also beneficial
            from an economic point of view due to the economics of scale – of these technologies, like storages and so
            on, it costs less to build a storage for a kilo stored if it’s large than if it’s small. The same goes for
            production facilities like electrolysis. When it comes to air travel, I don’t… I can’t say anything about
            that, because this is one of the things about hydrogen that I don’t know anything about the feasibility of.
            That would just be pure speculation.
            </Typography>
            <Typography style={{fontWeight: 500}}>
            How large will the potential in extracting hydrogen from surplus energy in solar panels and wind turbines
            be? Does it require a tradeoff between producing power and hydrogen, or will the surplus energy be sufficient?
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
            I think there you can get the answer from Espen on that one. I took a PHD on that topic and then a phd
            student afterwards took a PhD on the topic and then Espen has completed more or less his PhD on the topic.
            This is not one easy answer on that, but Espen can train himself to answer that. I can give a short answer
            first: The question is whether you shall produce hydrogen from surplus energy or not. Most of our analysis
            shows that if you build a hydrogen plant, this is quite costly. You would then like to produce as much
            hydrogen as you can when you have the plant. You not only produce hydrogen when you have excess energy.
            Our research shows that if you need hydrogen, and you want to build a hydrogen infrastructure, then you use
            that as the primary application of your energy – and then you use the power grid to sell the excess energy.
            So that’s the simple answer. You build hydrogen infrastructure and then you utilize it as much as you can,
            but maybe not 100% - if you overinvest a little bit in hydrogen production capacity then you have some
            flexibility. Espen’s work has shown that there are economic benefits and environmental benefits of having
            some flexibility in the hydrogen production so that you can produce a little bit more when the wind is high
            than when the wind is low. Come back to that with Espen – he should answer that question in a nice way.
            </Typography>
            <Typography style={{fontWeight: 500}}>
            How big of an impact will the use of electrical vehicles have on the power system? Is it possible that hydro
            vehicles can be a better option to support the rated powers of the components in the power system?
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
            Yeah – that, I would – say that it would be approximately the same. And I have a very good reason for
            saying so: because if we imagine that all hydrogen like in Norway comes from natural gas with reforming and
            CCS, then the answer would be yes: hydrogen vehicles would be a better option looking at the capacity of
            the grid because all the hydrogen is produced from natural gas – so you don’t use the electricity system
            at all. So that is one extreme scenario. The other extreme scenario is where you don’t use the natural gas,
            but you produce every kilo of hydrogen from renewable energy sources. Then no: this would be worse for the
            grid, because then you need electricity to produce hydrogen. And you use more electricity to produce hydrogen
            for vehicles instead of electricity for vehicles because of the efficiency. So in a natural gas hydrogen
            world you don’t need so much power and power systems. You don’t need so much power in a natural gas world
            for hydro production, but in the other case you need a lot. I would say, they weight a bit against each
            other, and you end up with the same as with electric vehicles. Espen has made a great energy system analysis
            about that recently, should be able to expand a bit on that question.
            </Typography>

            <Typography style={{fontWeight: 500}}>
            How can hydrogen provide heat to a building, and how does this work?
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
            Yeah – I don’t know too much about that. I think that the point is that it shouldn’t be very difficult.
            The point is that if you have a fuel cell system, you have losses. Losses are heat –
            so you need to – first of all, I think that it’s not ideal to burn hydrogen for heating without producing
            electricity at the same time. I think that it takes – if you look at the chain from the energy source to
            hydrogen, and then you finally have hydrogen into your building, you have done a lot of steps to make a fuel
            that is a bit precious. It’s costly, and very advanced way to get there – to get this hydrogen. And then
            you should try to use this for something more than just boiling pasta water. So I would say that when you
            have first got hydrogen into your building, I believe that the smartest thing to do is to produce electricity
            and then heat – heat is produced by excess heat that you use to heat up water in a heat exchanger and so on.
            Combined with hidden power elsewhere. This is not my expert field – some think that using hydrogen only as
            heat, but I think as a combination with power.
            </Typography>

<Typography style={{fontWeight: 500}}>
            Sources suggest that the use of hydrogen as a heat-provider for buildings has a larger potential in countries
            where there is the possibility of using existing LNG infrastructure. In other countries where there is a
            high level of established infrastructure for electrical heating, using hydrogen for heating purposes will
            require a higher initial investment. Therefor the integration of hydrogen energy might not be as relevant
            in these countries. What is your opinion on this?

</Typography>
<Typography>
            I agree on that. I think that the infrastructure is an important factor an also as I discussed earlier.
            You can still use hydrogen for other purposes than heating, unless you are in more like remote places
            where you produce hydrogen from solar panels from windmills near where you need the energy, and then you can
            use power. You use hydrogen for powering, and then you can use the excess heat as well. Maybe the Utsira
            case is relevant there – it was shown how wind power could be used to produce hydrogen which was used in a
            fuel cell and in a combustion engine, but heat was not used in the demo project. And that would be
            beneficial from a total energy efficiency and probably economic point of view.
</Typography>
            <Typography style={{fontWeight: 500}}>

            Will the use of hydrogen as a heating source mainly be relevant in large scale projects like office and
            public buildings, or can it have a sufficient potential in a private context, for example in a residential unit?
            </Typography>
            <Typography>

            I think it’s more ready – easier to integrate in larger buildings. I also think it’s easier to get
            agreements to test out there. So, it’s not either or – it’s like office and public buildings first, and then
            if it works there, the step to residential buildings is – there is a shorter step to there. You don’t
            jump over the office to get to the residential unit – I think that if we succeed with the larger buildings
            then it’s easier to take the technology in use in residential units. And maybe there are some good demo
            examples maybe in office and public buildings from what I know.

            Does hydrogen as an energy source have other usage areas within a building other than heating?
            </Typography>
            <Typography>

            Yes – micropower plant, if you have hydrogen you can fuel your car as well. If hydrogen cars get cheaper in
            due time, it might be a good alternative to electric vehicles in some areas of the world, e.g. in the U.S.
            for long distance driving etc. and if you have hydrogen available in your residence you can use it for 3
            purposes right?

            Could hydrogen fuel cells be used in an environment independent of large networks, such as in a private
            resident, to supply electricity? Would it be economically viable? Would it be energy efficient compared to
            other available alternatives?
            </Typography>
            <Typography>

            So I said a bit about that before, but I think that – well the more expensive the external energy supply is,
            for instance on a remote island and you have costly power or costly diesel oil as an energy source, then
            locally produced hydrogen can be very attractive. Then you can have a smaller distribution system for hydrogen
            locally or regionally And then you produce power in fuel cells – It could be very attractive in the same
            way that solar cells are very attractive in residential because if it gets easy to install and not too
            costly it is a good alternative to large scale power production also. Because if you can just buy fuel
            cells with integrated heat utilization just as a box, plug and play more or less where you have a hydrogen
            supply system. Whether it becomes economically viable or not – it’s not easy to say yet. I’m a bit realistic
            on that – it takes some time, it seems, to get fuel cells to that stage of development. But it’s energy
            efficient if you utilize the heat in addition.

            What are some of the disadvantages of the use of hydrogen as a power and heat provider in buildings?
            </Typography>

            <Typography>

            It is the availability and cost of hydrogen into buildings that is the biggest disadvantage. Another issue
            that should not be underestimated is that the public opinion on hydrogen as an energy carrier can be problematic.
            To have hydrogen gas in your  house, at least in Norway where we are not used to that and think gas systems
            are very dangerous, which they can potentially be, but in other areas of the world natural gas is very
            natural to use in residential buildings. And then the step to hydrogen might not be so big. I should
            consider though, since you are looking at this from a bit broader scale, that you can search a bit about
            what’s going on on different synthetic hydrogen carriers. There are some systems, concepts regarding ammonia,
            methanol etc. Hydrogen is the energy carrier, but you can combine it with other chemicals to provide
            liquid energy carriers that are easy to use. Ammonia might be challenging. But that’s also a challenge – to
            get acceptance.

            </Typography>
            <Typography style={{fontWeight: 500}}>
            Despite all the research and media coverage of hydrogen as an energy source, it is still not that commonly
            used. Why is hydrogen energy not more prevalent today? What is required for this to happen?
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
            The question, I think, is hard to answer; it seems that hydrogen has some challenges with respect to – you
            need a combination of success storage to make it happen in total. It’s not only to develop cheap fuel cells
            – if you develop cheap fuel cells, you still have to provide an economically viable hydrogen production chain.
            So, the main difficulty with hydrogen is that you need to solve several things more or less at once when it
            comes to the techno-economic performance. So, you need to improve hydrogen production, make it easier to
            distribute hydrogen, and improve the end use technologies. I think that the key here is the fuel cells. And
            therefore, also the energy research funding in hydrogen technology has focused a lot on fuel cells. Here we
            have the largest gap between where we are and where we want to be. So, if we solve the fuel cell cost question,
            that if you get reliable efficient fuel cells at reasonable prices, then the other steps of the chain can be
            solved more easily. Because then you have proved ok, we have an end use application and those applications
            are there, and the rest of the chain can come after. I think fuel cells are the key.

            What is the possible cost-advantages or disadvantages of using hydrogen compared to fossil fuel and other
            renewable energy sources? If hydrogen is the most expensive, what action will be required to reduce costs
            so that hydrogen can become competitive?
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
            Yeah – so here again it is the fuel cell technology. If we get a breakthrough in fuel cell technology
            like we did lithium-iron batteries and solar cells, then hydrogen can be affordable as an alternative.
            Again, Espen’s research has shown that it is possible to produce hydrogen and deliver it at competitive
            prices in an energy system. But you need to have the end use in place. So, it’s possible to produce at a
            reasonable cost and deliver, so we need the fuel cells to work properly.

            Will use of hydrogen at the consumer level (i.e. Private transportations and heating) reduce the expenses
            at any level for the consumer?
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
            If carbon emissions are priced correctly, it can potentially be economically beneficial yes. Because then the
            fossil fuel alternative would be so expensive that it’s ruled out. Still, it has to compete with just
            electrifying everything and it’s not really easy to say whether it’s better than direct electricity for
            private transport and heating.

            In which application could hydrogen as an energy source be most beneficial?
            </Typography>

            <Typography>

I think hydrogen is going to be most useful in applications were the use of hydrogen in itself  bring some benefits
            because of the properties of hydrogen and some beneficial properties of hydrogen is for example like
            lightweight, so it is lightweight pr. unit of energy.

            Then you can think of fabrications such as airplanes, or drones or those types of applications were weight
            is limiting. This can also be like on ships or trucks, because sometimes the weights is limiting on for
            example trucks  when they driving over bridges and stuff then it can be very limiting if they
            use batteries and it can limit what kind of payload they can haul.


            And also, Hydrogen is beneficial if you need large volumes of energy or large amounts of energy.
            Then you can think of applications such as ships.

            What are some of the greatest disadvantages with the use of hydrogen?

            </Typography>
            <Typography>

            One of the main disadvantages if you use it for electricity storage it has a large loss, so quite low
            round trip efficiency. So, you will lose maybe the half of the energy and compared to one of the main
            alternatives which are batteries.  This is quite a lot. That’s maybe the main disadvantages. It can also
            be safety issues because it ignites very easily if it is trapped in a confined aera, but if it has
            ventilation to air It also dissolves very easily. It requires the proper safety engineering.

            How do hydrogen fuel cells work?


</Typography>
            <Typography>

            When you produce hydrogen from electricity you do something that’s called electrolysis, so you apply
            electric current to water, and you have some membranes that only conducts some type of ions. As a result of these
            process you produce hydrogen and oxygen. And in a fuel cell is kind of the other way around. You put in
            hydrogen and oxygen and then you get electricity out of that. So, you have membranes that are leading
            one type of ion which forces the electricity around the circuit.

            In which part of the world is hydrogen usage most prevalent? Are there any parts of the world where
            significant progress is being made? In which parts of the world does hydrogen have the greatest potential for
            usage as an energy source?

            </Typography>
            <Typography>


            It can be everywhere.  Probably for different applications based on the location,
            maybe in aeras were you have a lot of production you can have a lot of hydrogen production as well
            to complement renewables and  facilitate integrations of renewables, but then in aeras were  you have
            a lot of energy deficit you can have hydrogen usage for example. Then you can also use it for transports
            everywhere. I think in the future it would be everywhere.

            There's a lot of examples. in the Netherlands they are is starting to produce hydrogen in proximity
            to some of the chemical plants they have because they use hydrogen and, in the production, or in the
            chemical production process. They have used hydrogen in those processes for a while but now they are
            also starting to use it from electricity where they previously used natural gas and I also know that
            they have for example in the port of Amsterdam they are using hydrogen for different applications. In
            Germany for example they're running trains on hydrogen and there's many places around the world where
            they're running buses on hydrogen and you can take California as an example there they have a decent
            amount of hydrogen fueled cars as well and in Japan they also have some had some hydrogen cars and
            they're very interested in hydrogen as an energy carrier. There’re many more examples of hydrogen usage.

            So, first of all hydrogen is an energy carrier not an energy source so you should compare it to
            electricity instead of. You shouldn't say energy source. So, we're it has the greatest potential
            (relatert til siste halvdel av spørsmålet over) I think this goes into what I said before it has
            potential everywhere so I think it's very dependent on the CO2 price and this CO2 prices reflects
            how intensely do you want to get rid of CO2 and I think it's going to be very important when you get
            a little bit further decarbonization so when you get a higher shares of renewables and you start to
            handle the emitting sources that are hard to decarbonize then hydrogen can be very important.

            <Typography style={{fontWeight: 500}}>

            In the future, how do you think hydrogen will be used in smaller scale application, such as in private
            residences, vehicle’s etc.? What about in larger scale environments, such as in cities, larger transport
            networks (shipping, air-travel) etc.?
            </Typography>
            <Typography>

            So for vehicles I think it will start with the more heavy applications such as trucks or ships but then
            it might also be used to some extent for private vehicles but I think batteries are probably going to
            dominate that market quite a bit and for residences you might see some type of combined heat and power
            production where you can produce electricity but then you can also get some heat from the fuel cell
            and this can be like a way of maybe increasing the efficiency of fuel cell because as a lot of the
            losses in the form of heat so if you actually can utilize the heat you would also increase the
            efficiency. They do this for natural gas in CHP plants, but it can also be done for hydrogen,
            I think. They're also looking at how you can use hydrogen in relation to district heating networks
            and stuff like that.

            </Typography>
            <Typography>

            This is this is probably the scale where hydrogen is going to be most useful, I think when you're
            talking about large quantities of energy. Because then batteries are struggling more when you talk
            about large amounts of energy because it's expensive and then you start to move into areas, or something
            called the sector coplin. We have a lot of renewables this sectors, then I am talking about heating,
            electricity and hydrogen can be one of those sectors, natural gas can be one of those sectors they're going
            to be more interconnected and when you look at the city they often have like heating networks natural gas
            networks and electricity networks an and maybe you can in some cases you can feed hydrogen into the natural
            gas network. You could produce hydrogen from electricity so you can use it to bridge all of these networks
            and you can also use some of the heat for district heating. You can also imagine that you take some of the
            natural gas networks and convert them completely to hydrogen. These kinds of networks are very common in
            Europe and in UK for example

            How will the use of hydrogen as a spare battery within the power grid be used? Will it speed up the process
            of aligning consumption and production?
            </Typography>
            <Typography>


            I think it would be used to balance out the fluctuations in renewable energy production so when you have a
            lot of renewable energy production you can produce hydrogen. If you can use it for hydrogen specific end use
            it's the best. Then you don't regenerate it to electricity to the grid but you use it maybe in mobile
            applications or something like that but you can also regenerate it to electricity and feed it into the grid
            via
            turbines or fuel cells but then you need a big variation in electricity price to make it profitable because
            you have so much losses. The best case is if you can have some kind of flexible demand that's only
            withdrawing energy from the electricity system and then you use it for the end users to decarbonize the
            things that you
            can only do with hydrogen

            If you think about solar energy, then batteries are probably very well suited but for example for wind
            energy or seasonal variations then you need something like hydrogen because batteries are way too expensive
            for storing energy over such a long time. Batteries are better for day-to-day or some days like 1 - 3 days
            maybe but not much more than that. Hydrogen can store it for four weeks so it's going to be very important
            when the share of renewable energy is getting very high. When is when you're reaching like 60, 70, 80% it is
            going to be crucial.

            How large will the potential in extracting hydrogen from surplus energy in solar panels and wind turbines
            be? Does it require a trade-off between producing power and hydrogen, or will the surplus energy be
            sufficient?
            </Typography>

            <Typography>

            Yeah so it's going to be dependent on the penetration of this renewables because if you can use the
            electricity directly without going via hydrogen its better because of the efficiency but in the end when the
            penetration is large enough you would have to go through hydrogen because of supply is not matching demand
            and batteries are too expensive so then you need I think I've said some of this before

            In general you would use you would produce most of the hydrogen during surplus periods, but it's also
            beneficial to be able to produce hydrogen when it's not a surplus as well, it depends on what kind of
            hydrogen demand you have do you need to deliver hydrogen all the time or are you just using it for any
            storage for the grid. In general, you will be producing when there is a surplus because it's cheaper

            How big of an impact will the use of electrical vehicles have on the power system? Is there a possibility
            that hydrogen-driven vehicles can be a better option to support the rated powers of the components in the
            power system?
            </Typography>
            <Typography>

            it's hard to answer but when you think about electric vehicles supporting the power system they can have an impact for sure but, you also have to think about  the degradation of the batteries of the vehicle themselves so the costs might be a bit high. For hydrogen what kind of end use you have it's not that important. I think it's more that you have some use for hydrogen and you won’t store the energy in the car some self as you do with the EV`s. Then you store energy in the cars themselves and the batteries but for hydrogen vehicles I think you would store it at the pump maybe in some storage tanks and degradation is much less of an issue it's more the energy loss. if it's a given that you're going to use hydrogen vehicles it can deliver a lot of flexibility at a low costs but you have to think about the energy losses too so it's a hard question so it might it might require some more research actually

            Sources suggest that the use of hydrogen as a heat-provider for buildings has a larger potential in countries where there is the possibility of using existing LNG infrastructure. In other countries where there is a high level of established infrastructure for electrical heating, using hydrogen for heating purposes will require a higher initial investment. Therefor the integration of hydrogen energy might not be as relevant in these countries. What is your opinion on this?
            </Typography>
            <Typography>

            I think hydrogen will be relevant everywhere but for heating of houses, if you only think of that end use it's probably better if you already have the district heating infrastructure or the natural gas infrastructure. You have pipelines of either lots water or natural gas going to the houses. I think you can probably make more efficient use of the hydrogen for heating. Using it like having a fuel cell or something in everyone's every single house or a hydrogen boiler or something is going to be very expensive so it’s always an advantage to have some already existing infrastructure. I think you have to probably make some upgrades to the existing infrastructure at least if you're going to supplement natural gas for hydrogen. For heating you just use it as a heat source, you're not transporting the hydrogen itself so it’s probably very directly applicable to district heating networks.

            I heard that you said LNG but maybe you meant district heating I don't know

            Natural gas distribution infrastructure. LNG is liquefied natural gas so it's is more like ships transporting liquid.

            Could hydrogen fuel cells be used in an environment independent of a larger network, such as in a private residence, to supply electricity? Would it be economically viable? Would it be efficient compared to other available alternatives?
            </Typography>

            <Typography>

            Yeah it could but it would be very expensive. Then it's probably better if you have a local energy production like solar and you can use batteries is probably much cheaper solution. This is quite common for houses nowadays and it's been coming for like cabins and stuff for a while but in places where you don't have that much sunshine then you can imagine using hydrogen instead of batteries, because you can store it over longer periods so you can produce maybe hydrogen in the summer and then you have electricity in the winter. I don't know if it was Telenor or Telia or something, but they have some mobile base station that they need to power somewhere in the mountains in western Norway I think, and then they're actually using hydrogen fuel cells to power those mobile base stations. Because batteries are not sufficient because you can have long periods where you have too little sunshine, so they also had the solar panels on these base stations so it's cheaper than connecting them to the electrical grid

            Yeah so it's very dependent on the situation but especially for like remote areas or areas that are weakly connected to the electricity grid it can be cheaper, it depends on the alternative so it can be cheaper than building transmission lines maybe in some cases and dependent on the energy source can in some cases be cheaper than batteries. So, it's dependent on both location and energy source.

            It might not always be the most energy efficient alternative, because you have quite some losses but in some cases, it might be the only alternative because of the costs. So, you have to weigh energy efficiency against the costs and if you need heat as well it might improve the case. You have to do accounting on many fronts cut off both efficiency costs energy sources energy requirements so it's very case dependent I would say

            Despite all the research and media coverage of hydrogen as energy carrier, it is still not that commonly used. Why is hydrogen energy not more prevalent today? What is required for this to happen?
            </Typography>
            <Typography>

            Yeah it's been a hot topic many times before so it typically goes like every 10 years there's a lot of excitement around hydrogen and then it dies down a little bit and then it comes back but I think a lot of the reason why it's hasn't happened before now it's first of all it's the capital costs so it's the cost of the electrolyzers and the fuel cells. You need something to get it started so to reduce the costs of producing these types of equipment’s and then you also need the cheap energy, so this is the operating costs. You need cheap renewables and I think like now both of those pieces are in place you got the renewable so much cheaper than they were just ten years ago and also the costs of the hydrogen equipment is also dropping very fast. So, both of these things are very important for seeing utilization of hydrogen. It’s probably famous last words but this might be the time where it actually happens

            What are the possible cost advantages or disadvantages of using hydrogen compared to fossil fuel and other renewable energy sources? If hydrogen is the most expensive, what action will be required to reduce costs so that hydrogen can become more competitive?
            </Typography>
            <Typography>

            Yeah so, I kind of mentioned some of this already. First of all, hydrogen is not the energy sources its an energy carrier. So, you can't really compare it to fossil fuel or fossil sources or renewable sources. Hydrogen is very useful in complementing renewable energy sources and because of the variability and sometimes you have almost electricity for free and then losses don't matter that much anymore if you get it for free and what will be required to reducing the costs. I just said some of the things it's the capital cost of the hydrogen equipment as it's going down and it is, and the operating costs and I think for electrolyzers you have 70 high 70s to 80% of the cost of producing hydrogen is related to the electricity price so when you get a lot of cheap renewables when it's cheaper to build solar panels and wind farms electricity prices is going to go down at least and it's going to go a lot down in some periods when you have excess energy and then it's going to be really cheap or a lot cheaper to produce hydrogen so like yeah renewables is a key driver and the investment costs of the hydrogen equivalents
            </Typography>
            <Typography style={{fontWeight: 500}}>

            Will the use of hydrogen at a consumer level (ie private transportation and heating) reduce expenses at any level for the consumer?
            </Typography>
            <Typography>

            Yeah so, I think this is kind of related to economy of scale maybe. So, now it's still quite early in the deployment of electric hydrogen equipment so it's kind of expensive. It's much cheaper than it used to be, but it has potential to be much cheaper. I can take one example is that until now the electrolyzers, so the equipment used to produce hydrogen from electricity. it's been made by hand in Norway. We have very high labor costs so it's going to be very expensive equipment but now they are actually automating this process of producing the electrolyzers. Its driving down the costs a lot but then again, they are really dependent on some people that want their electrolyzers to have to supply at some volume in order to make the automation profitable. The level of consumption it's key to driving down the investment costs and then also the cost of hydrogen. That's one part of the equation. Then you also have the renewable energy part and that's not very independent from the use of hydrogen you can have a lot of renewable energy without having any hydrogen but still when you have more and more renewable energy hydrogen is going to be cheaper anyway. So, you have some parts that's dependent on the hydrogen consumption and you have some parts that are independent.
